Some library licensing limitations prevent us from opening RF Explorer native firmware as open source, but the PC Client and other tools are full open source code for the community to extend and adapt to specific needs.

Take a look at the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/rfexplorer/wiki/Welcome) for additional documentation, such as RS232 command interface specification or electric schematics.
