# Introduction #

There are many transmission sources out there. In particular, ISM bands are populated by a plethora of thousand of different gadgets, many of them using proprietary transmission patterns.

This small repository may help you to identify the source of a signal (or noise). Feel free to add your own contributions here, the larger the repository the better.

## 2.4GHz microwave oven ##
Detected 0.5 meters away. Note strong peak transmission at one frequency but noise spread across the whole span.

Making the span narrower, we can see center carrier (most likely video) and two sidebands (most likely sound)
